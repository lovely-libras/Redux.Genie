what could go wrong

generate
	- Rails: generates with mulitple models
	- Ducks: generates with mulitple models 

	- Rails: generates without defined actions
	- Ducks: generates without defined actions
	
	- Rails: generates without defined thunks
	- Ducks: generates without defined thunks
	
	- Rails: generates with defined actions
	- Ducks: generates with defined actions

	- Rails: generates with defined thunks
	- Ducks: generates with defined thunks

	- Rails: all the properties are defined on state
	- Ducks: all the properties are defined on state


update

	edge cases: if someone changes a property between update calls,
	action constants break

	- update to new model no actions or thunks defined- Crud True 
		- rails xx 
		- ducks xx 

	- update to new model no actions or thunks defined- Crud false 
		- rails xx 
		- ducks xx

	- update to new model with actions and thunks defined - CRUD true
		- rails xx
		- ducks xx
	
	- update to new model with actions and thunks defined - CRUD false
		- rails - xx
		- ducks - xx

	- update new actions on existing model with actions already defined 
		CRUD true
		- ducks  xx single xx multiple
		- rails  xx single  xx multiple

	- update new actions to model with actions not yet defined 
		- ducks  xx single  xx multiple
		- rails  xx single  xx multiple

	
	- update to new thunks to model with thunks already defined
		- ducks  xx single xx multiple
		- rails  xx single xx multiple

	- update to new thunks to model with thunks not yet defined
		- ducks  xx single xx multiple
		- rails  xx single xx multiple 

	- prevents adding duplicate models
		- ducks  single  multiple
		- rails  single  multiple

	- prevents adding duplicate actions
		- ducks single  multiple
		- rails  single  multiple 

	- prevents adding duplicate thunks
		- ducks single  multiple
		- rails single  multiple 

	- update to add subsequent new models
		- ducks single  multiple
		- rails single  multiple


    Thunks:
      - getAll:
          - "/api/Dux"
          - getAllCampus
      - getOne:
          - "/api/Dux/:dux"
          - getCampus

 - terminator:

    CRUD: false
    
    Slice:
      - WillBeBack: Boolean
      - OneLiners: Array
      - Sequels: Number

    Actions:
      - getJohnConnor
      - hastaLaVista

    Thunks:
      - getAll:
          - "/api/terminator"
          - getJohnConnor
      - getOne:
          - "/api/terminator/:terminator"
          - getJohnConnor


issues:

1. RESOLVED adding thunks changes action files
2. RESOLVED multiple action constants 
3. RESOLVED adding actions to model with no actions at all 
4. RESOLVED adding thunks to model wtih no thunks yet (Ducks only)


add

	- add new model with actions and thunks defined 
		- ducks - single - multiple
		- rails - single - multiple

	
	- add new model with and without defined actions, CRUD false 
		- ducks
		- rails


	- add new actions to model with actions already defined 
		- ducks 
		- rails xx single xx multiple


	- add new actions to model with actions not yet defined 
		- ducks 
		- rails xx single  xx multiple

	
	- add new thunks to model with thunks already defined
		- rails xx single xx muliple


	- add new thunks to model with thunks not yet defined
		- rails  single multiple 

	- prevents adding duplicate models
		- ducks 
		- rails xx

	- prevents adding duplicate actions
		- ducks
		- rails - single - multiple (FAILING for CRUD methods)

	- prevents adding duplicate thunks
		- ducks
		- rails single xx multiple xx
